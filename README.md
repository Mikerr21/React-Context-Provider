# React-Context-Provider   
The React Context hook, typically referred to as the useContext hook in the React.js, is a powerful feature for managing state and passing data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.     
Pros:     
*Global State Management which means 'useContext' allows for creating global state that can be accessed and modified by any component in your app     
*Avoid Prop Drilling.    
*Maintaining cleaner code.     
*Performance optimization which means optimized re-rendering.    
*Build re-usable components.
