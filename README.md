# React-Context-Provider   
The React Context hook, typically referred to as the useContext hook in the React.js, is a powerful feature for managing state and passing data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.     
Pros:     
*Global State Management which means 'useContext' allows for creating global state that can be accessed and modified by any component in your app     
*Avoid Prop Drilling.    
*Maintaining cleaner code.     
*Performance optimization which means optimized re-rendering.    
*Build re-usable components.

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
